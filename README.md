# AI DISCORD BOT

### To-do:
- Only one thread per user

### UI ideas (We could submit the bot features to a community vote):
- Bot Icon
- Bot Name
- Bot Personality
- ...

### Improvments:
- Main bot channel should have instructions with a button to open a thread with discord bot
- Link openAI thread with discord thread so the bot has chat history

### `thread.json` initial value:
```
{
    "threadCount": 0,
    "threads": [],
    "createdTimestamp": 0,
    "updatedTimestamp": 0
}
```
